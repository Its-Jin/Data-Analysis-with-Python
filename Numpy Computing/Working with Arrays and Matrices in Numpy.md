Numpy Array class is ```ndarray``` 
	What it means?
		ndarray = N dimensional array
			infinitely dimensional array dictated by shape.


# Creating Arrays of Different Shapes #CreatingArray
#### 1D Shaped Matrix 
```python 

arr1= np.array([1,2,3])
```


##### 2D Shaped Matrix 
```python 

arr2 = np.array([[1,2,3],
				 [4,5,6],
				 [7,8,9]])
```


#### 3D Shaped Matrix 
```python 

arr3 = np.arrat ([[[1,2,3],
				   [4,5,6]],
				   
				   [[7,8,9],
				   [11,12,13]]])
```
